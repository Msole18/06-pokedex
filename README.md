# Pokedex

This project is a Pokedex application developed with React. The application allows users to search, filter, and explore a list of Pokémon. It implements different functionalities such as searching by pokémon name and number, filtering by type, paging, and sorting Pokémon by different criteria.

This project was developed as part of my learning process in React and front-end development. My main goal with this Pokedex is to apply the knowledge I have acquired in this project.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, users will be able to:

- **Search Pokémon:** User can search by name or ID from the search bar at the top.
- **Filter Pokémons:** User can filter by types and adjust the range of pokemon listed by ID.
    - **Filter by type:** Allows the user to filter the Pokémon list by type (water, fire, plant, etc.).
    - **Filter by sequence:** Allows the user to indicate by ID the range of Pokémon to display in the list (from Pokémon #: 30 to Pokémon #: 70).
- **Sort the Pokémons:** The user can sort the Pokémon from highest to lowest ID, or from A-Z / Z-A by name.
- **Load more Pokémons:** A “Load More” button allows the user to bring more Pokémon to the list.
- **Pokémon info:** Allows the user to click on a Pokémon in the list and navigate to the page where all the information of the selected Pokémon is displayed.
